1 Introduction
A student’s education significantly impacts one's future by equipping individuals with essential
knowledge, skills, and critical thinking abilities, which can lead to better career prospects and
personal growth (Hanushek & Woessmann, 2006) . Educational institutions aim to enhance
undergraduate student performance by focusing on developing academic skills often completed
through teaching, feedback, and access to high-quality resources. However, non-academic factors,
such as time management, are often overlooked, with studies indicating that at least half of all
students face challenges in this area, including procrastination (Ozer et al., 2009, Solomon and
Rothblum, 1984) with the prevalence of these issues continuing to increase (Steel, 2007).
Research has demonstrated that effective time management techniques can reduce procrastination
and improve academic achievement (McKenzie & Gow, 2004) and (Trueman & Hartley, 1996). More
recent studies however, emphasise the importance of teaching students to incorporate these
techniques into their daily lives for maximum effectiveness (A. Kirillov et al. 2015, Adams R 2019).
Consequently, this project aims to develop an application that utilises these techniques to assist
students in their studies by enhancing their time management skills.
ScheduleMate is the proposed web application, which integrates multiple time management
techniques derived from background research and knowledge elicitation methods. Developed using
Node.js and Express frameworks, ScheduleMate features interconnected time management,
scheduling, and goal-setting techniques. Additionally, the application analyses users' schedule and
goal data, providing feedback on improvements through notifications. Furthermore, ScheduleMate
incorporates a language model to assist users in finding solutions to time management issues they
may encounter.
This report will outline the steps taken in this project, including background research and knowledge
elicitation, to identify optimal time management techniques. The report will also cover the project's
design, development, and testing phases. Lastly, an evaluation will be conducted to assess the
project's success and the extent to which it meets its objectives.

2 Background research
Existing literature on the psychology of time management was reviewed to gauge the effectiveness
of different time management techniques. Existing solutions were also reviewed to provide insight
into how these techniques have been implemented in practical tools to support time management
and how users have responded to them.
2.1 Literature review
2.1.1 Introduction
The primary objective of a time management app is to help users employ efficient time management
strategies, allowing them to remain organised and focused on their objectives. In this project, it is
essential to pinpoint the most effective time management techniques, specifically for students. A
thorough literature review has been carried out to gain a deeper understanding of these techniques
and their impact. The review explores previous research on various time management approaches
and examines external factors that may affect their efficacy. Specifically, three time management
techniques were investigated:
• Pomodoro Technique
• Time Scheduling
• Goal Setting
To expand the potential user base for the app, it was also important to explore whether different
personality characteristics affect time management. Results from these studies could influence the
app's functionality, increasing its usability for a wider audience. Therefore, towards the end of this
chapter, studies into the relationship between characteristics such as personality; age and gender,
are reviewed.
The final paragraph reflects the reviewed literature, where the results, limitations and
recommendations for future research are discussed.
2.1.2 Method
The key resources/repositories searched were Google Scholar and Scopus along with IEEE (for more
technical studies) and APA PsycArticles (for studies focusing on psychology). In addition, the Aston Library
was searched and help from Aston Library staff was sought to improve the search methods used.
In selecting research papers for inclusion in the literature review, several criteria were followed to ensure
the quality and relevance of the studies. Firstly it was crucial to consider only academic, peer-reviewed
papers, as these have undergone rigorous scrutiny and validation, ensuring their reliability. Additionally,
using studies with the most recent publication dates was necessary to avoid outdated information or
methodologies that may have been superseded by newer research. Finally, the research papers
considered were required to be based on empirical conclusions rather than anecdotal evidence to
guarantee the robustness and validity of the findings.
8
When searching for research papers on time management techniques, keywords were utilised to ensure
the most relevant and comprehensive results. The keywords used included more general terms such as
Time management, Students, Pomodoro, Time Scheduling, Goal setting, SMART goals, personality, age,
gender, and subject. By employing these keywords, the search focused on studies that examined various
aspects of time management, such as specific techniques (Pomodoro, Time Scheduling, and Goal setting)
and their effectiveness concerning students. Furthermore, the inclusion of keywords like personality, age,
gender, and subject allowed for the identification of research that investigated how external factors
might influence the success of these time management strategies. Overall, these keywords guided the
search process, resulting in a robust and comprehensive collection of research papers that address the
complexities of time management and its application in the context of students.
2.1.3 The Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro® Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late
1980s Cirillo (no date). It aims to enhance productivity by breaking work into short, focused
intervals, called "Pomodoro's", followed by brief breaks. Cirillo (no date) defines several steps
associated with this technique:
● Choose a task
● Set the Pomodoro® Timer to 25 minutes
● Work on the task until the Pomodoro® rings, then put a check on your sheet of paper
● Take a short break (Start with 5 minutes)
● Every 4 Pomodoro's, take a longer break."
● A default 25 minutes working length, which Cirillo suggests time can be set to anything.
Although Cirillo cites many benefits of this technique on his website, such as reducing interruptions
and improving concentration, there is a lack of links to scientific evidence supporting his claims.
Further studies have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of Cirillo’s methodology. One such
study by Gobbo & Vaccari (2008) measured the effects of the Pomodoro technique in extreme
programming teams. Whilst their results support the claims made by Cirillo, the authors fail to
include much detail on the evaluation methods used to validate their claims. This study was only
conducted on teams of software engineers. Although software engineers and students may face
similar time management issues, students will typically work in different environments (study
rooms, not offices) and have different motivations (securing a degree but no risk of getting fired).
Students also tend to work more independently than teams of software engineers; it is, therefore,
inappropriate to rely on this study as evidence that the Pomodoro technique would work for
students in general.
Usman (2020) conducted an 8-month study which included regular interviews with students before
and after implementing the Pomodoro method into their studies. Based on this study, Usman
suggests, "The PT® appeared to have addressed some of the reasons for multitasking, e.g. absence of
break, pleasure and mood regulation, ease of multitasking. However, there were other reasons for
multitasking that the PT® did not appear to have addressed, e.g. unconducive environment for study,
absence of deadline/time pressure, peer expectations” (2020, pg. 235). Usman (2020) also suggests
that the factors governing the effectiveness of the Pomodoro technique are:
● Assessment deadlines
9
● Convergence of platform for the study
● Conducive environment for study
● Participants’ active state
● Participants not adhering to the rules of the PT
● Allowing time to get used to the PT
● Group study
Usman only interviewed eight students, all of whom were studying scientific subjects. The small
sample size and lack of variety mean his results are likely to exhibit bias, given that students from
different subjects differ in their approaches to learning (Kember et al., 2008). As such, Usman’s
findings only evidence that the Pomodoro technique addresses procrastination issues for (a few)
students within a scientific field. For the results of his study to be more generalisable, Usman would
have needed to increase his sample size and the variety of students interviewed.
A similar study with a larger sample size was conducted by Dizon et al. (2021), who tested 114
students before and after implementing the Pomodoro technique into their studies. Dizon et al.
concluded that “the application of the Pomodoro technique is more effective in reducing
procrastination behaviour among nursing students” (2021, pg. 63). A limitation of this study was that
Dizon et al. (2021) used multiple time management techniques along with the Pomodoro technique,
meaning that it cannot be clear if the Pomodoro was, in fact, the main contributing factor to their
results.
2.1.4 Time scheduling
A study by (Bake et al., 2018) investigates the effects of a scheduling intervention in an online class,
focusing on its impact on student's academic performance, particularly those with poor time
management skills. The intervention involved encouraging students to schedule when they would
watch lecture videos. During the first week of the course, the intervention improved academic
performance, with the positive effects being more pronounced among students who self-reported
poor time management skills. However, these advantages faded in the following weeks of the
course. It can therefore be argued that students follow their schedules less closely than in the first
week.
While it is uncertain the reason for this drop-off, Bake speculates it could be because students'
habits and other commitments became more established as the term progressed, making it more
challenging to adhere to their planned schedules. Alternatively, it can be argued that students may
lack the motivation to stick to a schedule for longer periods. The study also found that the positive
effects of the scheduling intervention did not persist after its removal. This suggests that the
intervention may have failed to successfully teach students lasting time management skills or induce
a change in their time management behaviour.
In their 2018 study, Beattie and colleagues examined the factors differentiating between college
students who thrive and those who struggle. The findings reveal that short study hours and
cramming are the habits most closely linked to poor academic performance. According to the study,
underachievers have difficulty maintaining their anticipated study hours as the term progresses. Text
analysis indicates that these students are aware of their time management issues and express a
desire to study more, yet fail to follow through. These findings suggest that students may achieve
greater success by planning their time effectively. Moreover, the text analysis implies that
unsuccessful students may lack the resources or awareness to identify and address their time
10
management problems and that an increased understanding of these issues could lead to improved
academic performance.
Nonetheless, the study has limitations that could undermine its credibility. The majority of the
findings rely on self-reported data, which may be subject to biases. Furthermore, the research
sample exclusively comprised economics students, limiting the generalizability of the results to the
wider student population. Another concern is the follow-up survey's lower response rate than the
initial survey (83% vs 97%). This discrepancy could introduce non-response bias, as the
characteristics or experiences of students who completed the follow-up survey may differ from
those who did not. Beattie et al. (2018) attribute this difference to drop-outs, implying that the
study's results do not account for failed students. This omission is significant, as it could be argued
that these students will most likely struggle with time management issues.
Britton and Tessor's 1991 study suggests that students who demonstrate proficiency in short-range
planning and time attitudes tend to achieve better academic outcomes. Interestingly, long-range
planning, which involves setting goals for an entire quarter and organising work habits, did not
correlate with the grade point average. Although this indicates that scheduling may positively impact
short-term time management, it remains unclear whether planning or time attitudes drive this
effect. Britton and Tessor's research has similar limitations to Beattie et al.'s 2018 study, including a
sample consisting solely of college students enrolled in psychology courses, potentially reducing the
generalizability of the findings to the broader college student population. Additionally, the timemanagement questionnaire relied on self-reporting, which can be subject to biases.
Another factor to consider is the study's publication date of 1991. Given that more than three
decades have passed since its conduct, there may have been significant changes in the educational
landscape, encompassing teaching methods and student characteristics. External factors beyond the
educational context have also substantially influenced time management issues. For instance, as Liu
F et al. (2022) highlighted, the proliferation of mobile phones has increased levels of procrastination,
which could, in turn, affect students' ability to adhere to a schedule.
Wajcman (2018) suggests that dedication and review are required to make scheduling work
properly. Wajcman study involved interviewing high-performance people such as Silicon Valley
Engineers and Athletes who incorporate schedules within their daily lives. In roles where time
management is essential, it can be argued that a lack of dedication and review of the student’s
schedule may have been a reason for its lack of longevity. However, there are potential drawbacks
to Wajcmans study. The lack of empirical data means the results may have been skewed due to
unforeseen conditions such as subjectivity or researcher bias. Bake's results can be considered more
accurate as they used quantitative data displaying a clearer picture of the effects of scheduling.
Additionally, while one could view the implementation of time management techniques used by
successful individuals as proven effective, it does not necessarily guarantee student results. As
mentioned earlier, students may face different time management issues that are not prevalent in
most professional work.
One study by B Tang (2020) involved him interviewing students one month and four months after
implementing a time-blocking calendar into their studies. Tang states the results as “Four months
after the implementation, a higher percentage of the student workers felt more positive about this
scheduling system in that it contributed to:
● Improving their work attendance and efficiency.
● The perception of their life is more organised.
11
● The proficiency in using the online calendar tool which will benefit them in the long term.” -
by B Tang (2020) Page 262
Contrary to Britton and Tessor's 1991 paper, this paper suggests that in the long term, using
scheduling calendars positively affects students' time management. However, the lack of scientific
evaluation methods indicates the possibility of inaccurate in this statement. As the results from this
study were wholly based entirely on opinions, biases are not considered. To improve the accuracy of
results, Tang should specify other characteristics of the students, e.g. demographic, age and subject,
as these factors may affect the effectiveness of time schedules.
2.1.5 Goal Setting
Throughout the literature review on goal setting, it became apparent that Locke's goal-setting
theory has significantly developed in this field and remains prevalent in most recent studies on goal
setting. Locke (1968) proposed four ways of manipulating goals, which can be summarised as
follows:
1. Instructions: Directly providing specific goals or objectives for individuals to achieve.
2. Time limits: Imposing deadlines or time constraints to encourage goal achievement.
3. Knowledge scores and competition: Indirectly influencing goals by providing feedback on
performance and fostering competition among individuals.
4. Incentives: Using rewards such as money, praise, or participation to indirectly influence goalsetting behaviour.
In another study, Locke examined a decade's worth of laboratory and field studies on the effects of
goal setting and performance. He found that 90% of the time, specific and challenging (but not
excessively challenging) goals led to higher performance than easy goals. The results indicate that
five goal-setting principles can improve the likelihood of success:
1. Clarity: Goals should be clear and specific, making it easier to understand what needs to be
accomplished.
2. Challenge: Goals should be difficult but attainable to motivate individuals to put forth the
effort.
3. Commitment: Individuals should be committed to their goals and believe in their ability to
achieve them.
4. Feedback: Regular feedback on performance and progress can help individuals adjust their
efforts and strategies.
5. Task complexity: Goals should consider the complexity of the task and allow enough time for
completion.
A crucial point to consider from this research is that a significant contributing factor to the success of
goal setting is how one defines their goal. While Locke (1968) also mentions external measures as
influencing goals, this method might be impractical for a web application. As these findings are
based on studies conducted in the 1960s, it could therefore be argued that they may not be as
relevant in today's society, where technology has increased levels of procrastination among young
people (Liu F et al., 2022), making it more challenging for students to adhere to their goals. However,
Locke's (1968) theory is still applied in recent studies (Covington, 2000; Hambrick Hitt & Tucker,
2015), suggesting that these findings remain relevant.
Covington (2000) reviewed the literature on goal theory, examining how achievement goals
influence school achievement through cognitive and self-regulation mechanisms. The research
12
demonstrated that students with learning goals tend to engage in more self-regulated learning,
deep-level processing, and adaptive attributions for their successes and failures, leading to higher
academic achievement. Importantly, while learning goals are positively associated with pride and
satisfaction in success, they are negatively associated with anxiety in the event of failure. This
supports Locke's emphasis on the importance of goal definition, as poor definition could reverse the
intended effects. While this literature review provides a more recent overview of goal-setting
research among students compared to Locke's (1968) paper, it is still 23 years old and may not
account for recent changes within education or student characteristics.
Considering the importance of defining goals, it is essential to acknowledge any changes within the
discussion of goal setting. A more recent preventive ideology on defining goals has been Rubin's
(2002) 'SMART goals. Professor R Rubin states that for a goal to be clear and reachable, each one
should be (Rubin R, 2002):
● Specific
● Measurable
● Achievable
● Relevant
● Time-bound
Rubin later proposed updating the acronym to 'SMARTER' by adding 'Evaluated' and 'Reviewed.' This
refinement aligns more closely with Locke's definition, as he emphasised the significance of
reviewing goals to enhance the likelihood of success (Locke, 1968).
Recent studies have assessed the effectiveness of SMART goals on students. A study by Bahrami et
al. (2021) assigned tasks to two groups of university students, with one group having prior
experience with the SMART goal program. The results revealed that "this brief intervention
increased reported goal attainment" (Bahrami Z et al., 2021, p. 879). This study included a large
number of participants of diverse ages and genders. However, a limitation of this research is that the
effects of SMART goals were only monitored for a week. Consequently, this study cannot
conclusively suggest that SMART goals are effective over more extended periods. As Wajcman
(2018) highlighted earlier in this review, time management techniques can only be successful longterm if the individual remains committed.
Similarly, a study by Muñoz-Olano & Hurtado-Parrado (2017) examined the effects of SMART goal
clarification on academic procrastination among college students. The results demonstrated that
"participants who received the goal clarification treatment exhibited a significant reduction in
academic procrastination compared to those in the control condition" (Muñoz-Olano & HurtadoParrado, 2017, p. 179). The significance of this study lies in its extended duration, in contrast to
Bahrami's research, which provides further insight into the long-term effectiveness of SMART goals.
2.1.6 Personality Traits and Gender
Many of the studies previously examined provide limited information about their participants, which
could be a significant oversight, as factors such as gender, personality, and age may influence the
effectiveness of time management techniques. Consequently, this literature review has been
expanded to assess research on factors beyond time management techniques that affect an
individual's time management abilities. Exploring these additional factors is vital for better
understanding user needs, enabling the development of a more inclusive and effective time
management application.
13
A recent study by Albar et al. (2022) investigated the relationship between personality traits and
learning strategies. Participants completed the NEO-FFI-3 questionnaire to identify dominant traits
within their personalities, which included:
• Openness to experience
• Conscientiousness
• Neuroticism
• Extraversion
• Agreeableness
This study drew two conclusions. First, conscientious individuals exhibit better time management,
while neurotic individuals would benefit most from time management due to their weaker focus and
heightened anxiety levels (Albar R et al., 2022).
Secondly, the study revealed that females are more committed to learning and using academic
resources than males. This may be explained by the reported correlation between females and the
traits of agreeableness and extraversion (Albar R et al., 2022). Although Albar's study included a
large sample size (309 participants), only medical students were involved. However, since the
personality test results showed a wide variety among the group, the fact that all students studied
the same subject became less relevant. Additional studies on this topic, such as Munt & Merydith
(2012), were analysed for this literature review. However, these studies primarily reaffirm the
findings of Albar et al., emphasising the consistency of the results across different research.
While this chapter examines certain factors that influence a student's time management, a more
comprehensive overview of this topic requires further exploration of other factors. Additional
studies should be conducted to investigate the impact of socioeconomic factors and other
psychological aspects, such as motivation, self-efficacy, and stress. By broadening the scope of
research, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay of factors that affect time
management and develop more effective strategies tailored to individual needs.
2.1.8 Discussion
2.1.8.1 Pomodoro technique
While the Pomodoro Technique shows potential as a time management tool, the existing research
has limitations that prevent a definitive endorsement of its effectiveness for students. Further
investigation is necessary to determine the conditions under which the Pomodoro Technique may be
most beneficial.
Nonetheless, the current research on the Pomodoro Technique can offer insights for developing
requirements for a time management app targeting students. Usman (2020) indicates that factors
like assessment deadlines, the conduciveness of the study environment, and group study situations
can impact the effectiveness of the Pomodoro Technique. An app should enable users to customise
the Pomodoro Technique settings (e.g., work and break intervals, notifications) to accommodate
their unique study circumstances and preferences.
Dizon et al. (2021) discovered that combining the Pomodoro Technique with other time
management methods yielded positive outcomes. A time management app could incorporate
various complementary techniques, such as goal setting, task prioritisation, and progress tracking, to
enhance the app's overall effectiveness. The Albar et al. (2022) study demonstrated that personality
14
traits and gender differences could influence time management and learning strategies. To address
these differences, an app could integrate a personality assessment like the NEO-FFI-3, providing
tailored recommendations based on individual traits and learning preferences.
2.1.8.2 Time scheduling:
The discussion of the various studies presented highlights the complexities of time management and
the factors contributing to its effectiveness among students. The research findings, while insightful,
have limitations such as self-reported data, subject specificity, and small sample sizes, which call for
cautious interpretation. However, these studies can still provide valuable insights for the
development of a time management app tailored to students' needs.
Bake et al. (2018) emphasise the significance of scheduling in enhancing academic performance,
particularly for students with poor time management skills. The diminishing effects of the
intervention over time suggest that the app should integrate features that sustain user engagement
and motivation in the long term. For instance, the app could incorporate customisable reminders,
progress tracking, and rewards systems to promote consistent use and adherence to schedules.
Additionally, Bake et al. (2018) imply that unsuccessful students might lack the resources or
awareness to identify and address their time management issues, suggesting that increasing
understanding of these problems could lead to improved academic performance. This notion aligns
with Albar's assessment, which posits that males are less likely to adhere to a schedule as they tend
to be less inclined to use external resources. As with the Pomodoro Technique, a time management
application would benefit from customizability, allowing it to cater to a broader audience.
Wajcman (2018) and Tang (2020) stress the importance of dedication and review in ensuring the
effectiveness of scheduling. Maintaining a well-suited schedule is crucial, as an overly simplistic
schedule is inefficient. At the same time, one that is too difficult to follow could increase an
individual's anxiety (Wajcman, 2018), negatively impacting time management (Albar et al., 2022). A
scheduling app should incorporate features enabling students to periodically review their progress,
assess their time management strategies, and adjust their schedules accordingly. This approach
ensures that the app remains adaptive and relevant to the users' evolving needs, ultimately
supporting the development of effective time management habits.
2.1.8.3 Goal setting
Research demonstrates that setting goals can lead to increased motivation towards achieving those
goals. A key factor in this process is the accurate definition of goals. This literature review discussed
various methods for defining goals, with the SMARTER goal framework emerging as the most
relevant and evidence-based approach. As a result, it is essential for a time management application
that incorporates goal setting to facilitate users in effortlessly defining their goals using the
SMARTER criteria. Moreover, Covington (2000) identified that goal setting might exacerbate anxiety
levels due to concerns about potential failure. Given that anxiety is linked to poor time management
(Albar et al., 2022), it is crucial for a time management application to minimise this negative effect as
much as possible.
To gain a more in-depth understanding of the impact of goal setting, further research is required. A
significant area of exploration would be examining the long-term effects of goal-setting strategies.
This information will enable the app to integrate techniques that promote sustained engagement,
ensuring that users can consistently achieve their goals over time.
15
2.1.8.4 General
All these studies have limitations and potential biases, suggesting that they should be used
cautiously. Many findings rely on self-reporting, which can contain conscious or unconscious bias
and lead to inaccurate results. Another limitation is that the authors need to consider differences in
demographics, age and economic status, which may impact the effectiveness of time management.
Studies that do not consider different demographics may be unwittingly skewing data. However,
Albar et al. (2022) provide an interesting argument for the lack of studies on personality in their
research: “Employing personality sciences in the context of mentoring students is commonly faced
with scepticism and concern that the risks of stereotyping outweigh the benefits of using them.
Therefore, commonly many educators disregard personality and eliminate the use of its tools from
their mentorship practice” (Albar et al., 2022, page).
More studies need to be conducted to evaluate the long-term impact on students and better
understand the effects of these time management techniques. These solutions are designed to be
used throughout one's education. Therefore, knowing if a student can remain motivated to use
these methods for extended periods is important. Additionally, more studies must analyse the
relationship between time management techniques and different subject areas. Modern education
offers a wide variety of different subjects students can study. Each subject has different types of
study material and different methods of examination. Therefore, the time management technique's
success will likely differ through different subjects.
This literature review has not evidenced a method of time management that is likely to be successful
within different cohorts and for a long time frame. What it does do, however, is establish both pros
and cons of certain methods. The next step in reviewing the current time management apps was
using the evidence from this literature review to inform the design process.
16
2.2 Existing Solutions
A review of existing solutions for time management (mobile and web apps) was conducted to
understand better how time management techniques have already been implemented into
commercial products. Following the previous literature review results, it was important to analyse
current applications that implemented all techniques already explored.
Only those with over one million downloads and a rating above four stars were considered to ensure the
evaluation of high-quality applications. Examining popular and high-quality applications is essential, as it
allows the assessment to better represent current market trends, consumer preferences, and features
that strongly resonate with users. Furthermore, identifying key players enables a more effective
determination of potential market gaps.
The search keywords employed included 'time management,' 'Pomodoro,' 'scheduling,' and 'goal setting.'
The top three non-advertised, free apps that met the criteria were documented in a spreadsheet. Each
application was then downloaded and tested individually. The subsequent chapter summarises each
application and provides a detailed analysis of their respective features and design.
2.2.1 Forest – focus for productivity
URL - https://www.forestapp.cc/
Forest integrates the Pomodoro technique, enabling users to set customisable focus intervals (typically
25 minutes) followed by short breaks. Additionally, the app allows users to set custom focus durations
and break intervals. Forest also provides a selection of ambient sounds, such as rain, forest sounds and
cafe ambience.
Customisable focus intervals and breaks allow the application to cater to different work styles and
preferences, aligning with Usman's (2020) study, which suggests that the Pomodoro technique is more
effective when customised to fit the user's environment. Moreover, providing a selection of ambient
sounds is advantageous for the app, as it helps users become less distracted by their surroundings. This is
significant, considering Usman's (2020) study, which emphasises that a conducive environment for the
study is essential for successfully implementing the Pomodoro technique.
Forest uses gamification throughout the application. If users maintain focus for the set interval, a tree
grows; if they exit the app to use their phone for other purposes, the tree dies. Over time, users can grow
a virtual forest, visually representing their productivity and focus. This feature encourages the user to
re-engage and stay loyal to the app for extended periods. If a Pomodoro is not completed correctly,
e.g. the user cancels the Pomodoro halfway through, a withered tree is planted in their forest. The
aesthetically unpleasant 'dead trees' negatively affect the progress of the user's forest and are used
to remind the user to complete Pomodoro's. However, this feature needs to consider situations
where it is necessary to cancel a Pomodoro; for example, the user could have finished all their work
for the day or needed to make an emergency phone call. This lack of flexibility may not resonate
with users and discourage them from using the app.
The user receives coins when a Pomodoro is complete; the longer the Pomodoro, the larger the reward.
Increasing the Pomodoro timeframe suggests that the user would get more work done; however, this
might not be the case and could affect the student's efficiency. Parkinson's law suggests that work will
expand to fill the time allotted for completion (Parkinson, 1955). Therefore this feature could harm
students' efficiency as the increased timeframe does not guarantee a larger completion of the workload.
17
The app offers users detailed statistics on their focus sessions, including the number of trees planted,
time spent focusing, and total forest size. Users can also view their progress over various time periods,
such as daily, weekly, or monthly statistics.
This feature enables users to track and review their progress, which is crucial for effective time
management, as demonstrated by studies (Rubin R 2002, Wajcman 2018). One advantage of this feature
is that it facilitates goal setting, which has been shown to improve goal attainment (Bahrami Z et al.,
2021). However, the goal-setting process within Forest lacks specific frameworks for defining goals.
Covington's (2000) study highlights the importance of clearly defining goals, as vague goals can lead to
performance anxiety for some users, negatively impacting their productivity. Although users can utilise
the app's data to set goals using frameworks like SMART goals, Forest does not provide any built-in
functionality to support this process directly.
The app enables users to tag each focus session with a specific task or category, which allows them to
monitor the time spent on different activities. This feature promotes better time management and assists
users in identifying areas where they may need to adjust time allocation. Nevertheless, a potential
drawback of this feature is that categorising and tagging tasks could be time-consuming for some users,
leading to decreased efficiency.
Forest's blacklist feature enables users to block specific apps or websites they find distracting during
focus sessions. By adding apps or websites to the blacklist, users can prevent themselves from accessing
these distractions while working, fostering a more focused and productive environment. However,
according to user reviews, one issue with this feature is that the monitoring programs employed to track
app usage during focus sessions can significantly drain battery life. This decreased battery performance
may discourage users from utilising the app, as they might be concerned about their battery life during
prolonged work sessions.
Users can collaborate with friends, join group focus sessions and share their achievements on social
media, promoting a sense of community and accountability. This encourages users to stay focused and
work together towards common goals. Users can plant trees together; if one fails, they both fail.
Including accountability has the potential to motivate users to stick to their Pomodoro. However, a
potential defect in this feature is the potential of peer pressure and competitiveness negatively
impacting some users, causing stress and anxiety, negatively affecting time management (Covington,
2000).
A Chrome extension allows users to use the Pomodoro timer on their desktops. Being able to sync
their mobile account to their desktop allows the user to add to their progress. A Chrome extension is
a helpful feature that allows the user to progress even if they do not have access to or do not want
to use their phone. However, the Chrome extension does not have full mobile app functionality.
18
2.2.2 Pomodoro timer – appfx
URL - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pomodrone.app&hl=en_GB&gl=US
The AppFX Pomodoro Timer application is a straightforward Pomodoro timer offering a minimalistic
approach for users who prefer simplicity. It is simplicity, and limited features make it easy to use and
navigate, containing only two pages: the timer and a settings menu. Users can set goals for the number of
pomodoros completed daily, which may increase motivation. While the simplicity of this application
makes it straightforward to use, from the literature review results, it can be suggested that its features
are too simplistic to truly influence multiple aspects of time management (Usman, 2020). While it can be
argued that the goal-setting feature debunks this claim, the application does not provide incentives or
rewards for reaching set goals, which may limit motivation. Additionally, since users can set different
lengths of Pomodoros, the number of completed sessions may not accurately reflect the amount of work
done, rendering the goal-setting feature useless.
A large portion of the settings page is a grid with 20 different colour options for the UI, as shown in Figure
2.1, which takes up considerable space and offers limited practical value. Offering simpler options like
light and dark modes would be more useful as it would increase space for other features.
The app will alert the user when the Pomodoro is completed by sounding an alarm and displaying a
notification. This application provides a small amount of alert customizability; for example, a user can
select whether the alert will vibrate. This function could be improved by making the alerts more
customisable to match the user's environment. A user may not notice the notification within a loud
environment, or it may cause the user embarrassment if the notification occurs within a quiet setting.
2.2.3 TimeTune Focus Planner
URL - https://timetune.app/
TimeTune is a time scheduling application designed to help users create and maintain customised daily
routines to improve productivity and optimise their time management. One of TimeTune's key features is
the ability to create reusable templates of time blocks. This is especially beneficial for students, as their
schedules often consist of recurring events such as lectures, seminars and tutorials. Students save time
and effort using templates, as they can reuse the same template for their weekly schedule rather than
add each time block individually.
TimeTune's calendar synchronisation allows users to consolidate all their events in one place, providing a
clear overview of their schedule. Students may use multiple scheduling platforms for their studies; for
example, Aston uses the CELCAT calendar. Allowing students to display events from these calendars on
their application easily improves organisation as all of their events are in one place; additionally, this
reduces the time taken to set up the application.
However, as individual instances of the templates cannot be edited without affecting all the template
instances, it is difficult for users to account for daily changes or interruptions. Users may, therefore, find
the structured approach of TimeTune's scheduling system too rigid—especially those with more
unpredictable schedules or who prefer a flexible approach to time management.
Another useful feature of TimeTune is the reminders and notifications system. This feature reduces the
risk of a student missing an event. However, there is a potential downside to this feature. Frequent
notifications could interrupt users' workflow and create distractions if not managed properly. However,
TimeTune’s customisation feature minimises this issue and allows users to balance helpful reminders and
unwanted interruptions.
19
2.2.4 Sectograph
URL - https://sectograph.com/
Sectograph is a time management application that offers several features to help users manage their
daily schedule. Its defining feature, illustrated in Figure 2, is the clock-like circular design that resembles a
clock face, making it easy for users to grasp their schedule at a glance quickly. This unique layout is also
available for smartwatches, which is logical as the circular design uses the space on the watch very
efficiently. However, on the mobile app, this design may not be a significant improvement over the
standard schedule, as it only shows 12 hours of the day (24 hours is available for the paid version), and
individual events may not be clear on the clock face due to the limited space.
Another potential issue with Sectograph is that users may need to read multiple tutorials to understand
how the app functions once downloaded. Considering the app's limited functionality, forcing users to
undergo these tutorials might be unnecessary and off-putting. Users who prefer more traditional
calendar or list views or require more advanced scheduling features may not find Sectograph suitable for
their needs.
Overall, Sectograph is a standard scheduling application that offers no more than TimeTunes focus
planner other than its compatibility with smartwatches.
Figure 2.2 – Sectograph schedule

20
2.2.5 Dreamfora
URL - https://dreamfora.com/
Dreamfora is a goal-setting app that intends users to build sustainable habits to reach goals. For
each goal, the user describes the habits the user needs to accomplish this goal and the tasks
required to complete these habits. Additionally, users can add notes for each task and habit.
Encouraging the user to break goals down and comment promotes the user to define their goal in
more detail which is important for goal attainment (Covington, 2000). This feature additionally
allows the user to track and reflect on their current goal progress. As mentioned in the literature
review, feedback and reflection can improve the chances of users reaching their goals Locke (1968).
Dreamfora also includes features to help keep the user on track, such as reminders to complete
tasks and motivational messages when the app is opened. Including such notifications in a time
management application would be helpful as it reduces the risk of users forgetting to complete a
task. Additionally, it can possibly reinforce a positive mindset that can reduce negative emotions
such as anxiety and stress, which can hinder successful time management (Covington, 2000).
However, constant pop-ups can become disruptive.
Dreamfora also offers premade goals where individuals can use templates instead of inputting tasks.
This feature may increase ease of use; however, the tasks within the templates cannot be changed.
As the tasks are not customisable, it is more complex for the user to reflect on their progress as they
cannot make any changes. By making the templates customisable, users could change them based
on what suits them, increasing the possibility of reuse.
One standout feature of dreamfora includes the ability to post their accomplishments to an online
social media feed. This feature has the potential to motivate users, as once posted, users can receive
recognition from others. However, the app also shows the feed of others individuals. This can lead to
other time management issues, such as distraction and procrastination.
2.2.6 Loop habit tracker
Loop Habit Tracker offers several features to help users build and maintain good habits. Users can
create habits and set how often they should complete these. Goal completion can be quantified as
"yes or no" or measurable. Measurable habits allow the user to select more specific habits. For
example, instead of "go for a run", the user could record the distance/time of each run; this is
illustrated in Figure 3. This feature can therefore accommodate various types of habits.
This app is straightforward and has a clear user interface, as shown in Figure 2.3, making it very easy
to use; however, it lacks functionality. This app helps record user habits; however, there are no
functions to promote re-engagement or motivate the user to complete these habits. Therefore,
users may struggle to maintain this app for more extended periods.
The application allows users to review their habit traits, by providing visual progress representation,
streaks and habit scores; users, therefore, have more information on their progress to analyse.
However, due to the lack of re-engagement features, the results may be inaccurate due to users not
updating their progress.

2.2.7 Trello
Trello is a web-based project management tool used to organise and prioritise tasks. The tool allows
users to create boards for different projects and add cards for individual tasks. Although Trello
mainly operates as a Kanban board, tasks can be visualised in various formats, including a calendar
and weekly schedule. This makes the application acceptable to students who prefer different
organisational formats. Figure 2.3 illustrates Trello's calendar display.
Trello makes it easy for individuals to edit their dashboards by implementing drag and drop. This
makes it a lot easier for users to make changes to their dashboard compared to forms which other
apps use. This flexibility will better account for sudden changes within one's schedule.
Trello allows users to categorise and filter tasks using colour coordination, allowing them to better
visualise their tasks in terms of different categories. This can be useful within an app catering to
students as tasks can be categorised into aspects such as subjects or assessments.
Trello enables multiple users to work on a project simultaneously, making it an ideal tool for teams
to collaborate on tasks and projects. This feature is unnecessary for a student time management app
as most of the work would be individual, it would be possible to include a collaborative feature
similar to Trello's; however, this would rely on the other students using the same application.
Trello integrates with various tools and apps like Google Drive and Slack. This allows the student to
customise their platform to suit their needs better.
Trello is also available on mobile, making the user’s information accessible away from their desktop.
This would be useful for students as they can check and record progress away from their desktop,
which is very suitable for more practical subject areas.

2.2.8 Product Comparison Grid
A comprehensive product comparison grid
was utilised to effectively highlight the differences in features among the various time management
applications, as depicted in Figure 2.5. The grid is organised with headers that categorise each criterion,
providing a clear and systematic structure. The results from this comparison grid were utilised in our
discussion to analyse and determine the most optimal ways of implementing time management
techniques in various applications.
Figure 2.5 – Product comparison grid
24
2.2.8 Discussion
This discussion will compare the adoptions of time management techniques used by the applications and
identify the best practices for a time management application for students.
2.2.8.1 Pomodoro
Time management applications utilising the Pomodoro technique significantly benefit from
incorporating anti-distraction measures, as they help eliminate distractions during the timed work
sessions. The majority of these measures involve blocking specific apps or notifications. This is
particularly important for students, who may be more susceptible to distractions from their mobile
phones (Liu F et al. 2022). Consequently, the Pomodoro technique is more effective in mobile
applications, as they require administrative permissions to block notifications and other apps.
Pomodoro applications necessitate customisable notifications to inform users when a Pomodoro
session or break is complete, allowing for better adaptation to the user's environment. These
applications have implemented various features to enhance motivation, such as goal setting,
motivational messages, and analytics displays. Customisable notifications cater to a diverse range of
students who work in different study environments.
Regarding Pomodoro timers and goals, AppFx's Pomodoro timer demonstrates that it is more
effective to quantify goals based on the amount of time spent studying rather than the number of
Pomodoro sessions completed. This is because Pomodoro timers can be set to varying lengths, and
completing more sessions may not necessarily result in a greater amount of work being
accomplished within a given day. Furthermore, it is important to note that the number of study
hours completed in a day is not equivalent to the amount of work done by the student, as it does
not take into account work done outside of study sessions, such as attending lectures and tutorials,
which are essential for students.
2.2.8.2 Time Schedule
Apps that include a schedule should have a clear design allowing the user to see all events clearly as
opposed to Sectographs display. While making the application compatible with smart watches has
the potential of improving accessibility to students' smartwatches. This market is too niche and it is
better that the app is accessible without technological requirements.
Previous schedule issues include the risk of assigning too much or too little work. Schedules should
be easily customisable, allowing users to find and assign the correct workload. Trello's calendars
emulate this by incorporating a drag-and-drop technique. Additionally, students would benefit by
having repeatable events similar to TimeTunes focus planner. This would save time when emulating
weekly obligations such as lectures and seminars. Another feature of TimeTune is the ability to
merge the application’s calendar with other calendars. For example, students may have meetings
online using software such as Skype or Microsoft Teams. This feature would remove the need for
students to add these events themselves.
TimeTune’s schedule involved goal setting, It can be argued that this may harm an individual's ability
to stick to schedules as it could push them to add too much (Wajcman, 2018).
25
2.2.8.3 Goal Setting
Goal setting is a prevalent feature in the time management apps reviewed and is often linked with
to-do lists. Encouraging users to break down their goals and add comments promotes a more
detailed definition of their goals, which is crucial for goal attainment (Covington, 2000). This feature
also enables users to track and reflect on their current goal progress. As mentioned in the literature
review, feedback and reflection can significantly improve the chances of users reaching their goals
(Locke, 1968). By incorporating these elements into time management applications, developers can
create more effective tools that support users in achieving their objectives and enhancing their
overall productivity.
Goal-setting applications provided a framework for the user to define their goal, which is important
for its success (Covington, 2000). Examples of how existing solutions have implemented SMART are
as follows:
• Specific – Including a details input allows the user to add much detail to their goal
description
• Measurable – Most goal-setting applications allow the progress of goals to be easily
measured. The application 'Loop habit tracker' allows the user to specify the actual units,
increasing the measurement's accuracy.
• Achievable – The application Dreamfora allows users to break goals into subtasks. Breaking
down a goal into smaller tasks makes it clearer and more manageable, allowing the user to
focus on one specific task at a time rather than feeling overwhelmed by the larger goal.
• Relevant – The user determines the goal's relevance; therefore, it would be difficult to
include a feature that influences this measure.
• Time-constrained – Dreamfora allows the user to specify the due date of each goal.

3Knowledge Elicitation
Although the prior background research established a strong foundation for understanding various
time management techniques, the literature review and app analysis revealed gaps in existing
knowledge and tools. The objective of this chapter is to utilize knowledge elicitation methods to gain
a deeper comprehension of user requirements, as well as to identify the practices and tools
currently employed by students and the impact they have on their time management. This will
ultimately allow for the application's design and specifications refinement, ensuring a more effective
and tailored solution for users.
3.1 Method
The questionnaire was selected as the suitable knowledge elicitation method for several reasons.
Firstly, distributing questionnaires to a diverse group of students enables developers to collect a
wide range of perspectives and experiences related to time management, enhancing the
generalizability of the results. Secondly, the limited time frame for this project necessitated a rapid
method for obtaining quality feedback, making questionnaires an ideal choice due to their efficiency
and convenience.
Once the knowledge elicitation method was selected, the questionnaire had to be designed. The
questionnaire was divided into four sections. Below displays each section along with the reasoning
and objective of the questions;
Section 1 – Demographics
Questions 1-3 were used to record participants' age, subject of study and education experience.
Collecting demographic information helps ensure that the sample is representative of the target
population, increasing the generalizability and validity of the results. Additionally, demographic
variables can reveal patterns and trends in time management behaviours, strategies and tool
preferences across different groups. By understanding the preferences and needs of students across
different demographics, an application can be developed to offer content tailored to the specific
requirements of each discipline, resulting in a more effective and user-friendly experience.
Section 2 – Techniques and Challenges of the Student's time management
Questions 4-5 inquired about participants' typical time management practices concerning their
academic studies and their challenges in managing their time for these studies. Employing openended questions for these topics enables participants to offer more comprehensive and in-depth
responses, revealing subtle aspects and intricacies in their time management habits and challenges
that closed-ended questions may not capture. By posing these questions, valuable insights can be
obtained regarding students' time management methods, helping to identify their preferred
strategies and habits. The results from the remaining responses can then be leveraged to assess the
effectiveness of these techniques, providing a basis for the development of an application that aligns
with, complements, or enhances these existing practices.
27
Section 3 – Effects of Procrastination and Distraction
Questions 6-10 centred on the impact of procrastination and distractions on respondents.
Participants were asked to rate their procrastination and distraction levels on a scale from very
regularly to very rarely; the inclusion of these questions aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the
time management strategies identified earlier. Utilizing multiple-choice questions for this purpose
facilitated faster completion by users and produced more direct results, which streamlined the
analysis process.
Section 4 – Reflection on time management techniques and Applications
Questions 11-14 prompted users to reflect on the time management techniques they had used in
the past. By understanding the techniques participants previously employed, it was possible to
identify areas where existing solutions may still need to address users' needs fully. This knowledge
informed the development of features and functionalities that addressed these gaps and improved
existing solutions.
Once the questionnaire design was approved by the project tutor, to make sure the questionnaire
adhered to ethical guidelines, ethical approval documents were submitted. After receiving approval
from the ethics team, the questionnaire was distributed using Google Forms. This platform was
chosen due to its user-friendly distribution method compared to paper-based questionnaires,
enabling access to a wider audience through various channels, such as social media and university
group chats.
The questionnaire was available for two weeks before the responses were collected. The primary
technique to analyze the data was cross-tabulation. The following chapter discusses the findings.
28
3.2 Findings
After two weeks, the questionnaire garnered 36 responses. The collected data was subsequently cleaned
by removing records with inaccurate, inconclusive, or duplicated information. Five responses from
individuals who graduated over two years ago and one response with "N/A" as the year of study were
excluded, as they contradicted the participant information sheet requiring recent graduates.
The remaining data was structured to facilitate ease of analysis. Following the data cleaning process, a
demographic breakdown was conducted. The participant pool exhibited limited age diversity, with 26
respondents aged 18-24, three between 25-34, and one aged 45-54. This lack of age diversity restricts the
scope of analysis concerning students' ages. Additionally, there was limited diversity in the participants'
year of study: 19 were recent graduates, eight were in their final year, two were in their second year, and
one was in their first year. Comparing the experiences of recent graduates to final-year students would
provide limited insight, as recent graduates would likely recall their final-year experiences before
graduation.
Study subjects were categorized into broader fields: eight participants studied science, ten focused on
information technology, eight pursued engineering subjects, and six specialized in business subjects. It is
important to note that some participants studied multiple fields, resulting in 32 participants when
considering their areas of study.
The results showed that the students used three categories of time management techniques. These
included:
3 Task Lists
4 Scheduling
5 Pomodoro technique
Figure 3.1 – Bar chart displaying what time management issues students had when using certain time management techniques
29
To identify trends in the data, cross-tabulation was employed in conjunction with responses from
other questions. Figure 3.1 illustrates the prevalence of specific time management issues when
various time management techniques are utilized. The findings indicate that employing the
Pomodoro technique does not significantly impact these factors, as 80% of students reported poor
time estimation and lack of motivation. Furthermore, students who used the Pomodoro technique
were found to be the least effective in prioritizing tasks. This outcome aligns with the literature
review, which suggested that the Pomodoro technique successfully reduces procrastination but may
not influence other aspects of time management.
Students who used a task list or a schedule reported similar task prioritization and time estimation
results. However, those who relied on a task list experienced a 22.5% higher lack of motivation than
those using schedules. 81.8% of all students reported a lack of consistent motivation to study. As
highlighted in the literature review, several studies demonstrate that goal-setting can enhance
motivation towards goal achievement. Thus, the lack of motivation may stem from an absence of
goal-setting within their time management strategies, considering that only 6% of students reported
setting goals.
The influence of various time management techniques on procrastination and distraction levels was
subsequently examined. Figure 3.2 presents the levels of procrastination associated with different
time management techniques. Based on the literature review findings, it was anticipated that
students using the Pomodoro technique would exhibit the lowest levels of procrastination.
Surprisingly, students utilizing schedules reported marginally lower levels of procrastination.
These results suggest that using task lists has the least impact on reducing procrastination, with
62.5% of students indicating that they procrastinate either 'regularly' or 'very regularly.' Participants
were then asked to identify their primary causes of procrastination. This open-ended question
yielded responses that mostly fell into the following categories:
• Technology – such as phone notifications and social media
• Boredom
• Other Distractions – such as other people or noisy environments
Figure 3.2 – Bar Chart displaying the procrastination levels of different time management techniques
30
• Lack of motivation
• Task prioritization
Among students using the Pomodoro technique, 40% cited a lack of motivation as their primary
reason for procrastination – the highest among all techniques. However, none of the students
utilizing the Pomodoro technique identified distraction as their leading cause of procrastination.
Students who employed task lists found technology and other distractions to be their main causes of
procrastination. Among schedule users, 38% reported other distractions as their primary reason for
procrastination.
The same questions, focusing on distraction, were posed to the participants, with the results
illustrated in Figure 3.3. Students using the Pomodoro method reported the lowest distraction level,
with 60% responding 'Rarely' or 'Depends'. The responses for schedule users were more varied; 29%
indicated they were rarely distracted, while 65% reported being distracted 'regularly' or 'very
regularly. Responses from students who used task lists exhibited a similar pattern. Technology and
‘other people’ were the primary response for all methods on the cause of distraction.
Figure 3.3 – Bar Chart displaying the distraction levels of different time management techniques
31
As stated in the introduction of this chapter, this knowledge elicitation process aimed to address
gaps in the current literature concerning demographic differences in time management. Data on
study subjects were therefore analyzed. The initial goal was to consider participants' ages and
educational experiences; however, the responses needed to exhibit more variation to identify
reliable patterns.
Upon analyzing the data by study subject, it was found that science students reported the highest
level of procrastination, with 100% indicating that they procrastinate either 'regularly' or 'very
regularly'. In contrast, engineering students' responses were more varied, with 50% responding
'rarely' or 'depends'. Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5 show each subject's leading causes of procrastination
and distraction.
Figure 3.4 – A bar chart showing the causes of procrastination for different subjects
32
The results show that technology emerges as the most significant cause of procrastination and
distraction, particularly for IT and science students. One possible explanation could be the inherent
technology usage within their studies; for instance, computer science students constantly rely on
computers, providing instant access to distracting websites and applications that can sidetrack them
from their work. In comparison, business students may be required to engage in more physical tasks.
Another noteworthy observation is that the causes of procrastination were more varied than those
of distraction.
Business and engineering students identified poor time estimation as the primary impact on their
studies, with 83% and 75%, respectively. Conversely, science and IT students reported a lack of
motivation as the primary impact, with 86% and 80%, respectively.
The objective for the last two sections was to uncover any patterns related to the success or
challenges of a time management technique or software/application. Since most participants have
never used or currently do not use a time management software/application, the responses did not
provide a clear conclusion, as the answers were unique. However, similar reasons emerged for why
students stopped using time management techniques. Students who employed schedules found
them either too rigid or ineffective. The recurring issue of students' inability to implement schedules
effectively is highlighted in a study by Wajcman (2018), which suggests that a schedule must be wellsuited to the user, as one that is too easy is inefficient, while one that is too difficult to follow may
increase anxiety. Students who used the Pomodoro technique reported that they were not
accomplishing enough work before each break, and using Pomodoro actually led to increased
distractions from technology.

3.3 Discussion
The analysis of the questionnaire results aimed to identify the optimal time management technique
for a new application. While the Pomodoro Technique effectively reduced procrastination and
limited distractions, as supported by Dizon et al. (2021), it fell short in areas such as time estimation,
motivation and task prioritization. Consequently, a time management application could benefit from
incorporating a Pomodoro timer, but it would also require additional features to address its
limitations.
The results revealed that schedules had a comparable impact on reducing procrastination as the
Pomodoro timer, and students who used schedules experienced fewer motivation issues. This
implies that combining a schedule and a Pomodoro timer might hinder the application's
effectiveness, as they share similar effects. It could be argued that a schedule might be more
effective since it affects other aspects of time management compared to the Pomodoro timer.
Both task lists and schedules were more effective at prioritizing tasks than the Pomodoro timer.
However, nearly 40% of students who used these techniques reported issues with prioritization,
suggesting that a time management application should include additional measures to address task
prioritization successfully. Task lists and schedules yielded varied results across multiple questions,
making it challenging to pinpoint their precise effectiveness. This could indicate that participants did
not optimize the use of both methods. Wajcman (2018) emphasizes the importance of utilizing a
schedule effectively for success. Therefore, a time management application should communicate
this to users and enable them to evaluate the success of their schedules. As students who used task
lists faced procrastination issues, a time management application incorporating a task list should
also integrate a schedule or Pomodoro timer to mitigate these problems.
The questionnaire revealed that none of the techniques significantly impacted motivation levels, an
area in which over 80% of students experienced difficulties. Goal setting could enhance motivation
by improving goal attainment (Bahrami Z et al., 2021). However, the questionnaire could not
determine the effects of goal setting due to the limited number of respondents using it. As
technology was the primary cause of time management issues, incorporating methods to reduce
distractions, such as app and website blockers, could significantly improve the application's
effectiveness for students.
Although comparing students' subject areas revealed intriguing trends, a more diverse subject group
is necessary for a comprehensive conclusion. The results did not include responses from subject
areas such as English languages, History, and other languages. It is crucial to consider these
disciplines, as their distinct learning and assessment methods could influence the effectiveness of
time management techniques for students.

4 Requirements
Trends, common issues and best practices from the previous two chapters are extracted and
evaluated to determine the functionalities that users most desire which would be included within
this application.
Scheduling and goal setting has been selected as this application's primary time management
techniques. The app review indicated that this combination is not commonly used, which sets this
application apart. Both knowledge elicitation results and literature suggest that users may lose
motivation to adhere to a schedule over the long term, so incorporating goal setting should enhance
motivation.
Wajcman (2018) and Tang (2020) emphasize the significance of commitment and review in ensuring
the effectiveness of scheduling. Therefore, our application will incorporate features that enable
users to assess the effectiveness of their schedules. While some apps have attempted this by
providing user analytics, these approaches often fail to encourage users to review and evaluate their
progress thoroughly. This application will offer more detailed insights and actionable feedback to
increase the uniqueness to help users improve their time management. This approach also
addresses the issue identified by Blake et al. (2018) of raising awareness to help users identify and
address their time management challenges.
Our literature review underscored the importance of well-defined goals (Covington, 2000). The
SMART goal framework will be utilized when guiding users in defining their objectives. Each goal will
be assigned a priority level to assist students with poor task prioritization, as the questionnaire
results indicated this is a common issue.
Sections 4.1 and 4.2 state the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Functional
requirements define a system or product's essential features and capabilities, specifying its intended
behaviour. In contrast, non-functional requirements characterize the overall attributes or qualities of
the system or product.
4.1 Functional Requirements
Below are the functional requirements of the system. This defines the needs and goals of the system to
guide the design and development process. MOSCOW analysis (Clegg, 2013) was used to prioritize the
requirements and objectives of a software system and ensure that the most critical tasks are completed
first. The acronym MOSCOW stands for:
• Must have - These are critical requirements or features essential for the project to succeed. They
are non-negotiable and must be implemented.
• Should have - These requirements are important but not critical. Although they add significant
value to the project or product, their absence would not render it a failure.
• Could have - These requirements or features are desirable but not necessary. If implemented,
they are considered "nice to have" and can enhance the project or product. However, their
absence would not significantly impact the overall success.
• Would have - These requirements or features are the lowest priority and are not planned for the
current project or product version.

38
A comprehensive overview of the front-end and back-end design will be presented in this design
chapter. The rationale behind each design choice will be discussed, considering the objectives and
requirements of this project.
5.1 Back-End design
5.1.1 Application Type
A web-based platform and an Android application were the considered potential solutions for this
time management system. The advantages and disadvantages of each option were thoroughly
discussed and analysed, keeping in mind the needs of the students and the project requirements.
This comprehensive evaluation aimed to identify the most optimal solution that best caters to the
intended audience and aligns with the project's objectives.
Mobile phone usage restrictions in educational institutions can challenge the accessibility of a time
management app for students. Due to these constraints, a mobile solution may not be ideal, as
students may not be able to use the app as frequently during school hours.
Furthermore, schools and universities often provide desktop equipment, such as computers in
libraries and labs, for temporary use by students. It is essential for students to have access to their
schedules, goals, and to-do lists wherever they work. In this context, an Android application would
be less accessible, as students would not have permission to install it on institutional devices. On the
other hand, web-based applications can be accessed from any device with an internet connection
and a web browser, regardless of the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS). This
ensures students can access their schedules, goals, and tasks on any device, offering greater
flexibility and convenience.
Moreover, while 70% of mobile applications utilise the Android operating system (Statistica, 2023),
an Android application would be inaccessible to 30% of students using other operating systems. By
opting for a web-based solution, the deliverable can be a more inclusive and universally accessible
time management app for a diverse student population.
However, android applications have greater access to device-specific features such as push
notifications and integration with other platforms. This can enable richer and more interactive
experiences within a time management app, such as reminders and the device’s calendar
integration. However, the requirements for this system do not require any device-specific features.
Additionally, mobile applications can function offline, allowing students to access their time
management tools and data without an internet connection. This can be particularly useful in areas
with limited or unreliable connectivity, ensuring that students can manage their time effectively at
all times.
Finally, mobile applications are optimised for specific platforms and can leverage device hardware
directly, resulting in faster performance and smoother user experiences. Despite this advantage, the
performance difference is negligible as the requirements of this system do not require a large
amount of back-end complexity.
Considering the pros and cons of both application types, it was concluded that a web-based
application would develop a more accessible application and streamline the development process,
39
leveraging prior experience. This consideration was crucial due to the constrained timeline of this
project.
5.1.2 Development framework
Due diligence on development frameworks was conducted to select the best solution. Both Node.js
and Django were evaluated as potential options. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime
environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side. It utilises Google's
V8 JavaScript engine and features an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model (Node.Js Foundation,
2023). Django is an open-source Python web framework. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
architectural pattern, providing built-in tools for easy database management, user authentication
and template rendering. (Django Software Foundation, 2023)
Node js's event-driven architecture can handle real-time updates efficiently. This is essential for
many of the requirements of this application. For example, for requirement 3.1, once users create an
event, it should update the calendar, which is only possible via real-time updates.
Django provides a built-in authentication system (Django Software Foundation, 2023), which can
simplify requirements one and two. Additionally, Django has a powerful templating engine that
makes it easy to create dynamic HTML pages (Django Software Foundation, 2023), which can be
useful for rendering pages, however, due to Node. Js’s extensive range of packages, an application
using Node Js could still offer these features, for example, the package EJS allows dynamic front end
rendering (EJS, no date).
These frameworks utilise JavaScript and Python, respectively. While Node.js offers superior
performance due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, the relatively low back-end
complexity of the time management application suggests that Django's performance would be
sufficient for the project's needs.
Given the limited timeframe available for application development, personal familiarity with each
technology significantly influences the decision, as it is impractical to allocate time for learning new
technologies. With eight months of professional experience using Node.js and completing the
'Internet Applications and Techniques' and 'Internet Computing' modules, it was determined that
Node.js would be the most suitable back-end framework for this project. Becoming proficient with
Django's features carries the risk of consuming excessive time, potentially jeopardising the project
deadline.

5.1.3 Data Storage
5.1.3.1 Storage Technology
In this time management application, handling structured data is a primary concern. Therefore, a
relational database is the ideal choice, as it is designed to store structured data efficiently and
effectively manage relationships between entities. Both MySQL and PostgreSQL were considered
potential database management systems for this project.
PostgreSQL is renowned for its robust performance when dealing with complex queries (IBM, 2021).
However, MySQL was ultimately chosen for its superior performance in read-heavy workloads and
straightforward write operations, which aligns more closely with the requirements of this
application. Furthermore, the advanced querying capabilities offered by PostgreSQL are not
essential for the relatively simple queries needed in this time management application.
5.1.3.2 Required fields
Following the results from the requirements analysis, the data storage requires the capacity to store
information in the following categories:
User Information
• Id - A unique identifier for each user to establish relationships between users and their
events, goals, subjects, and tasks.
• Name - The full name of the user, used for personalisation and display purposes.
• Email - The user's email address, used for authentication purposes
• Password - The user's encrypted password is used for authentication and maintaining
account security.
Event Data
• Id - A unique identifier for each event.
• Date - The date of the event.
• Subject Id - A reference to the associated subject, if applicable.
• Event type - The type of event (e.g., lecture, tutorial).
• Location - The physical or virtual location of the event.
• Start time - The start time of the event.
• End time - The end time of the event.
• Repeat days - The days on which the event repeats, if applicable (e.g., "Monday,
Wednesday, Friday").
• Repeat until - The date until which the event repeats, if applicable.
• User id - A reference to the associated user.
Goal Data
• Id- A unique identifier for each goal.
• Name - The name or description of the goal.
41
• Due date - The date by which the goal should be achieved.
• Priority - The importance or urgency of the goal (e.g., high, medium, low).
• Subject id - A reference to the associated subject, if applicable.
• User id - A reference to the associated user.
Subject Data
• Id - A unique identifier for each subject.
• Name - The name or description of the subject.
• Required Hours - The number of hours allocated to the subject.
• Display Colour - The color used to distinguish the subject in the application visually.
• User id - A reference to the associated user.
Task Data
• Id - A unique identifier for each task.
• Goal id - A reference to the associated goal.
• Name - The name or description of the task.
• Completed - A boolean value indicating whether the task is completed or not.
Task session data
• Id - A unique identifier for each task session.
• Task - A reference to the associated task.
• Start -The start time of the task session.
• End - The end time of the task session.
• Date - The date of the task session.
• User Id - A reference to the associated user.
5.1.3.3 Relationship modelling
An entity relationship diagram was utilised to visually represent the database structure shown in
figure 5.1. Each table details each field and its corresponding data type. Additionally, the
relationships and multiplicities between each table are demonstrated. Finally, keys are
demonstrated with a PK (primary key) or FK (Foreign key) next to the field name.
42
5.2 Front-End design
With limited front-end design experience, exploring optimal solutions for the application's user interface
was essential. The study materials from the Interaction Design module and Jenifer Tidwell's "Designing
Figure 5.1: Entity relationship diagram for time management application
43
Interfaces" were consulted to achieve this. These resources significantly influenced the design decisions
discussed in this chapter.
5.2.1 User interface structure
The initial stage of the front-end design was identifying the structure and organisation of the user
interface. The application's overall flow of the application can be identified by utilising a flowchart,
as displayed in figure 5.2 and figure 5.3. It was important that the dashboard would contain clear
entry points to each dashboard function (Tidwell, 2011). Although figure 5.3 does not demonstrate it
successfully, it is also important that each page can go back to the dashboard.
5.2.2 layout
Wireframes were utilised to visually represent the basic structure and layout of the initial design's
user interface. Wireframes were the tool used to display the layout of each application page.
Outside of the dashboard, all other pages had similar layouts which consisted of a form. This chapter
Figure 5.2 – Login System Flowchart diagram
Figure 5.3 – Main System Flowchart diagram
44
focuses on the design decisions of the dashboard and other forms. The following chapter discusses
the decisions made when designing the layout for the application
5.2.1 Forms
The reading pattern for each form is top-to-bottom, as shown in Figures 5.4 and 5.5. Therefore to
follow the natural flow, the completion button was placed at the bottom after every input field.
Additionally, textual labels were used over icons for these buttons, improving the clarity of the
form's function.
5.3.2 Dashboard
Upon logging in, the user dashboard is displayed using a tiled panel layout shown in figure 5.6. The
tiled panel approach is highly effective for users who want to view multiple elements simultaneously
with minimal effort in managing windows. It enables the presentation of numerous features in one
central location, which is crucial because it can display the calendar and goals on a single
page(Tidwell, 2011). The sidebar contains a list of navigational links, which serve as clear entry
points for users to access specific features or functionalities within the application. (Tidwell, 2011)
Figure 5.4 – Landing Page Wireframe
Figure 5.5 – New Goal Wireframe
45
As discovered in the review of the time management application Sectograph, schedules must be
clear to avoid confusion. The schedule, therefore, demands the most space on the page. However,
there is a potential drawback to this strategy. Tidwell (2011) indicates that such a layout aligns with
the centre stage pattern, establishing a visual hierarchy dominated by the central element. While
the schedule is a crucial aspect of the application, the goals are equally important, and this layout
might inadvertently shift focus away from the sidebar. Hours of the day
Figure 5.6 – Dashboard Wireframe
46
5.2.3 Element features
The following chapter highlights the design decisions made outside of the layout.
5.2.3.1 Colour
The chosen colour for this project was dark blue (#1d63a5). This was because dark blue is considered a
"cool" colour, conveying a sense of respectability and conservatism. White is also a cool colour, and
the overall colour scheme would lean towards a cooler and more professional appearance (Tidwell,
2011)
Requirement 5.1 mandates that students can colour-code their subjects, reducing cognitive load by
allowing users to rely on visual cues instead of textual descriptions. Figure 5.7 depicts colour coding
consistently applied throughout the dashboard to illustrate connections between subject goals and
events. One potential issue with this feature is the possibility of overwhelming users with too many
colours. To mitigate this, the main body of the application utilises three major hues of the chosen dark
blue. This approach aligns with Tidwell (2011), who recommends using only one, two, or at most three
major colour hues in the interface, selecting assorted values (levels of brightness) within those hues
(Tidwell, 2011). Furthermore, the sidebar and schedule background colours were chosen to create a
visual separation between the two components (Tidwell, 2011). Finally, hairlines where utilised to
separate different components within the sidebar (Tidwell, 2011).
Red was also used within the main application to alert users. This is shown in Figure 5.7 on the
notifications button. Red was used for this as red is a “warm” colour and would, therefore, in
contrast with blue, would draw attention and create a strong visual distinction from the rest of the
interface (Tidwell, 2011). This can effectively highlight important alerts and make them easily
noticeable to users.
Figure 5.7 – Dashboard Display
47
5.2.3.2 Buttons
All clickable objects on the interface incorporate hover tools, which change the cursor design when
hovering over a button. This provides visual feedback to users, indicating that an element is interactive or
clickable (Tidwell, 2011).
The Gestalt proximity principle asserts that objects in close proximity will be perceived as belonging
(Tidwell, 2011). This concept has been applied throughout the page. For instance, in Figure 5.7, buttons
such as the "edit goal" and "edit and delete subject" buttons are placed immediately after the associated
component. Additionally, grouped buttons are given the same graphical treatment to indicate
connectivity (Tidwell, 2011), as demonstrated by the weekly navigation buttons in Figure 5.7.
5.2.3.3 Text
sans-serif is selected as the main font because it is more readable on computer displays, especially at
smaller point sizes (Tidwell, 2011). Pixels may not render tiny serifs well, making sans-serif fonts like
these a better choice for body text and label fonts in GUIs (Tidwell, 2011).
Following Tidwell's (2011) assertion on logical hierarchies, various text sizes have been employed to
denote the relationship between elements. As illustrated in Figure 5.7, goals are presented with a
larger font size than their corresponding tasks. This visual distinction effectively conveys that the
tasks are subordinate components of the overarching goal.
5.2.3.4 Icon
Icons were utilised to reduce space consumption. It was made sure that they were all silhouette styles to
improve appearance. As shown in Figure 5.7 aggregation was used within the notifications icon to convey
a unique message.
5.2.3.5 Input fields

Design decisions were made to optimise user input. Combo boxes were used on input with a selected
range, such as selecting a subject when creating an event, as shown in Figure 5.8. This is quicker for the
user than a separate dialogue box (Tidwell, 2011,p. 351). A structured box was utilised for time inputs,
Figure 5.8 – New event form
selecting subject
Figure 5.9 – New event form
selecting time
Figure 5.10 – New event
form selecting date
48
as shown in Figure 5.9, which ensures the response is in the desired format (Tidwell, 2011,p. 352). The
hidden calendar was used for date inputs, which constrained the input to a suitable format, as shown in
Figure 5.10. Additionally, having the calendar hidden reduces space consumption (Tidwell, 2011,p. 355).
The repeat days remain concealed to optimise space utilisation until the user activates the "Repeats"
checkbox. This design choice ensures efficient use of screen real estate and guides the user to interact
with the appropriate input fields. Upon selecting the "Repeats" checkbox, as demonstrated in Figure
5.11, the form expands to reveal the repeat days options.

Another input design decision was to keep messages and controls together on the same page so the user
could read the message and make the form corrections easily, as shown in Figure 5.12, with no jumping
around or error-prone memorisation (Tidwell, 2011).

6 Development
Prior to development, due diligence relating to development options was completed. Development
procedures, frameworks and tools were researched, allowing for the most suitable selection. This
informed a development plan which ensured that the chosen solutions aligned with the project's goals
and requirements, maximising efficiency and productivity
6.1 Software lifecycle
The software development lifecycle impacts many aspects of the development process; therefore, it was
essential to select the appropriate lifecycle to maximise the project's success. Both the agile and waterfall
approach was considered.
6.1.1 Waterfall Model
The Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle model is a linear approach to software development. It is
characterised by a sequential flow of stages, with each stage depending on the successful completion of
the previous one (Royce, 1970). The waterfall model typically consists of the following stages:
• Requirements Gathering and Analysis: In this phase, all potential requirements for the system
under development are collected and documented in a requirements specification document.
• System Design: The requirements from the first phase are examined during this stage, and a
system design is created. This design outlines hardware and system requirements and defines
the overall system architecture.
• Implementation: Developers write the code for the software system based on the design
specifications. This involves programming, unit testing, and integration of different modules.
• Testing: Once the implementation is complete, the software system undergoes rigorous testing
to ensure that it meets the requirements and is free of defects. Testing typically involves
functional tests, performance tests, and user acceptance tests.
• Deployment: After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment,
making it available to end users.
• Maintenance: The software system is monitored and maintained to address any issues, bugs, or
enhancements needed in the future.
This method presents advantages and disadvantages that can impact the project outcome. Advantages of
the Waterfall method include its simplicity, as it follows a linear, sequential process with clearly defined
stages that are easy to understand. Each stage has specific deliverables providing structure, ensuring the
project stays on track and maintains quality. The linear structure and clear milestones make planning and
monitoring progress easier. The Waterfall model is particularly suitable for small projects with clear
requirements and minimal changes (Royce, 1970).
On the other hand, the Waterfall method has its share of disadvantages. Its inflexibility means it is not
well-suited for projects with changing requirements or evolving needs, as it is difficult to accommodate
changes once the development process has started. Furthermore, end users typically provide feedback
only after the system is complete, making it time-consuming to address any issues. Testing is performed
late in the development process, which can lead to the discovery of defects at a later stage, making them
more expensive and difficult to fix. Lastly, the Waterfall model does not promote frequent
communication with the end users, which may result in a final product that does not meet their
expectations or needs (Royce, 1970).
50
6.1.2 Agile
Agile development methodology is a modern, iterative approach to software development that
emphasises flexibility, collaboration and customer satisfaction. This approach breaks down projects into
small increments, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation to changes. Agile promotes close
collaboration among cross-functional team members and prioritises regular communication and feedback
loops. With adaptive planning processes, Agile allows for frequent revisions based on new information or
changes in scope. The methodology is focused on the early and continuous delivery of value, ensuring
that the final product meets the needs and expectations of end users (Beck et al., 2001).
Flexibility is a key advantage of Agile, as its iterative approach allows teams to adapt easily to changes in
requirements and priorities. This makes Agile suitable for projects with evolving needs or uncertain
scopes. Another benefit is the emphasis on collaboration, which encourages close interaction among
cross-functional team members and stakeholders. This results in improved communication, a better
understanding of requirements, and more efficient problem-solving. Agile also prioritises early and
continuous delivery of working software, enabling end users to provide feedback and derive value from
the product sooner. The iterative nature of Agile also aids in risk management, as it allows for early
identification and mitigation of risks, preventing issues from escalating later in the development process.
Lastly, Agile's focus on frequent testing and continuous integration enhances software quality (Beck et al.,
2001).
However, Agile does present some challenges. Its adaptive planning process can make it difficult to
predict the exact timeline of a project. The flexibility of Agile methodologies can sometimes result in
scope creep, where project goals and requirements expand beyond the initial plan, causing delays. (Beck
et al., 2001).
6.1.3 Discussion
Before initiating the development process, the Waterfall methodology was chosen as the preferred
software development lifecycle due to the stable nature of the requirements and the need for accurate
timeline estimation (Royce, 1970). This choice was particularly important for this project, as it had a strict
deadline, and the risk of scope creep had to be minimised. To successfully implement the Waterfall
method, Asana was employed as the project management tool for documenting and managing each
phase/
Figure 6.1 displays the Asana dashboard, showcasing the design and development phases. The
corresponding tasks, sub-tasks, and notes were added for every phase to ensure comprehensive
documentation and organisation. A thorough review was conducted upon completing all the items in a
specific phase. The associated tasks and deadlines were updated if any incomplete tasks were identified.
Conversely, if the phase was deemed complete, the project advanced to the next phase, maintaining a
structured and sequential approach throughout the development process.

However, upon the usability testing phase, changes in design were required, which meant the project
tilted towards more of an agile approach. Figure 6.2, displays the adapted waterfall methodology for this
project.

6.2 Development tools
This section will detail the development tools required to complete this project and optimise this
application.
6.2.1 Application deployment
Web applications typically run on hosted external servers (Fielding & Taylor, 2002); however, deploying
the application on a local machine for this project's development offered several advantages. These
advantages included the elimination of dependency on a stable internet connection for development,
allowing for a more seamless workflow. Furthermore, using a local machine enabled faster testing and
debugging. After each change, developers could directly modify the codebase and immediately observe
the effects without deploying the code to a remote server. This approach significantly reduced time spent
on iterative development tasks and facilitated quicker manual testing.
While deploying the application on another server might have provided some advantages, such as more
closely simulating a production environment, it was ultimately decided that the application would be
deployed on a local machine during the development phase. To achieve this, a development environment
compatible with Node.js and MySQL was required, allowing the application to be accessed through
localhost.
Various solutions, including XAMPP and WAMP, were evaluated, as both offered the benefits of Apache's
HTTP Server and MySQL configuration, making them suitable for running the application. Ultimately,
Xampp was selected due to prior development experience, which minimised configuration time and
leveraged familiarity with its folder structure and features
6.2.2 Plug-ins and Packages
Several plug-ins packages were employed to enhance the capabilities of Node.js and JavaScript for
the successful completion of this project. These additional tools augment the core functionality and
facilitate the development process while ensuring that the project requirements are met effectively
and efficiently.
For requirement 3, using a plug-in was deemed the most effective strategy for implementing the
schedule to mitigate the risk of development delays. Coding a complex feature like a schedule from
scratch can be time-consuming and affect other components' development. FullCalendar and
DayPilot were considered, as they were capable of meeting the system's requirements. FullCalendar
offered advantages such as time selection and dynamic data loading (fullCalendar, 2023), while
DayPilot provided multiple components, including a calendar, scheduler and Gantt chart (DayPilot,
2023). Ultimately, FullCalendar was chosen because it offered features that DayPilot did not, such as
time selection (FullCalendar, 2023), which is crucial for requirement 3.5. Additionally, the lite version
of DayPilot has limited features compared to FullCalendar (DayPilot, 2023).
Requirement 2.6.1 specified that passwords must be encrypted. The decision was made to utilise a
plug-in, specifically bcrypt (bcrypt, 2021), as this feature must sufficiently work and be tested to
maintain security. Bcrypt is a widely-used password hashing library that dynamically adjusts the
hashing cost according to hardware capabilities. As computers become more powerful, the cost
factor can be increased to maintain a high level of security against brute-force attacks. Furthermore,
bcrypt automatically generates a unique salt for each password, protecting against precomputed
dictionary attacks, also known as rainbow table attacks (bcrypt, 2021). Given that bcrypt met all
requirements for this system, alternative solutions were not explored.
53
Additional middleware was required, such as Body-parser, a middleware that parses incoming
request bodies in a middleware before the handlers, making it easier to handle and process data
submitted by users via forms (body-parser, 2020), and cookie-parser, a middleware that parses
cookies attached to client requests, facilitating the management of user sessions and authentication
(cookie-parser,2022).
As JavaScript or EJS does not include any technique for adding icons, an icon library was included.
FontAwesome was chosen as it had all the icons needed within the application's design
(FontAwesome, 2023).
The library Moment was used for working with dates and times, simplifying the application's
manipulation, formatting, and parsing of date and time data (Moment.js, 2023). This was needed to
format the due dates of the goals for requirement 3.5.
For requirement 5.1.1, it was decided that a natural language model would be used to select the
right solution to the user input. The plug-in Natural was required to aid in tasks like tokenisation,
stemming and classification (natural, 2023).
6.1.5 Integrated development environment
In selecting an appropriate IDE for this project, Visual Studio Code emerged as the optimal choice
due to its robust Git integration capabilities and extensive support for a diverse range of languages,
frameworks, and libraries, which are crucial for an application that necessitates various resources.
Although other IDEs, such as WebStorm and Atom, were evaluated, familiarity played a significant
role in the decision-making process. Ultimately, Visual Studio Code was deemed the most suitable
platform to facilitate efficient and effective development for this project.
54
6.2 Code standards
During development, code standards were established, attempting to maintain overall code quality and
readability: this section lists and evidences code standards used throughout the project.
6.2.1 Modularity
Complex code was broken down into smaller reusable functions, and different concerns were separated
into different files. The code was organised into separate files based on functionality. Figure 6.3 displays
part of the function that loads the dashboard. This code demonstrates how database operations and data
formatting concerns have been separated by leveraging helper functions from separate module
‘formatHelpers’.
6.2.2 Promises and async/await
Promises and async/wait is utilised to manage functions that do not complete immediately, such as
database queries. Figure 6.3 demonstrates how a promise was used to retrieve database information.
6.2.3 Error Handling
Error handling was implemented to identify, isolate, and fix issues during development. By adding this
code, the source of the error and how to address the error is more clear. Figure 6.4 demonstrates this by
including a try/catch block. This will attempt to run the code within the try block, if unsuccessful, the
error will be caught and displayed on the terminal.
Figure 6.3: Load dashboard function code
55
6.2.4 Environment variables
Environment variables were utilised to store sensitive information, such as database credentials. Figure
6.5 displays how environment variables were used to store the user's database credentials. This means
that malicious users cannot obtain access to the user's password with just the source code.
6.2.5 Comments
As displayed in Figure 6.3, comments were used throughout development to explain the purpose and
functionality of each part of the code.

6.3 Development Process
The development was conducted through weekly stages. Tutor meetings every Monday allowed
subsequent feedback on the feedback of project where any necessary adjustments to the requirements.
The following details the significant events and milestones achieved during each week:
6.3.1 Week 1
The environment setup was straightforward; however, it took some time to become acquainted with all
aspects and reacquaint certain elements. The calendar implementation progressed smoothly, as most of
the research was conducted during due diligence.
6.3.2 Weeks 2-4
Basic functionality for goal setting, events, and subjects was successfully implemented. However,
following a review by the module tutor, it was suggested that the application needed more complex
features to enhance the project's unique selling proposition (USP). Although this change introduced some
delays in development, the incorporation of new requirements ultimately resulted in a significantly
improved application.
6.3.3 Weeks 5-6
The primary objective of these weeks was to implement requirement 5, which represented one of the
most challenging phases of development. Due to delays in previous weeks, timely completion of this
requirement was crucial. The complexity of these requirements, including the data analysis functions,
added to the challenge of these weeks. An example of a particularly challenging function was the method
that calculated the time spent on each goal in Figure 6.7. This was challenging, considering the data
formatting required to perform the calculations to get the correct result.
57
For requirement 6, it was determined that a natural language processor (NLP) would be the optimal
solution. This part became particularly complex because there was no prior experience working with
language processors. Figure 6.7 displays the function to process the input; it became challenging due to
inexperience working with tokenisation and language models. However, the 'Natural' package and its
accompanying documentation (Natural, 2023) successfully facilitated the completion of requirements six
on schedule. Completing requirement 6 in the time frame was a notable achievement as it was the most
complex part of development.
Figure 6.6: Function to calculate the time on each goal
58
6.3.4 Week 7
During this sprint, the primary objective was integrating user management functionality into the
application and incorporating the specified design elements. This implementation proved to be more
challenging than anticipated. This oversight resulted from its late addition, necessitating the modification
of existing functions.
6.3.5 Week 8
Due to impending deadlines from other modules, the objectives for this sprint were scaled back to
accommodate the limited time available. Nonetheless, progress in implementing the CSS was successful.
6.3.6 Week 9
During this sprint, all design and functional requirements were successfully fulfilled, culminating in
creating of a minimum viable product for the project. In addition, a usability testing plan was developed,
accompanied by all necessary documentation to secure ethical approval.
6.3.7 Week 10
Upon obtaining ethical approval, the usability testing process was initiated. The usability tests were
efficient and successful because the testing plan was already in place, and participants had been preFigure 6.7: Function to process user input to find the time management solution
59
selected. As this marked the final scheduled development week, ensuring the completion of both the
redesign and development within the stipulated time frame were imperative.
6.4 Conclusion
Throughout the development process, careful planning, research, and decision-making were conducted
to ensure the success of the project. Various development tools, plugins, and packages were utilized to
enhance the application's capabilities and streamline the development process. Code standards were
established and maintained to ensure code quality and readability.
The development process of the project unfolded through a series of weekly stages, with each week
focusing on specific objectives and milestones. Regular meetings with the tutor allowed for constant
feedback and any necessary adjustments to the requirements. The environment setup, implementation
of basic functionality, and integration of more complex features such as data analysis functions and
natural language processing contributed to the project's unique selling proposition (USP).
Challenges and delays were encountered throughout the development process. The integration of user
management and design elements proved to be more complex than anticipated, but progress was made
despite limited time availability.

7 Testing
This chapter examines the various testing methodologies employed throughout the project,
including automated, manual, and usability testing. The primary objective of this testing phase is to
assess the application's functionality, identify potential issues, and make the necessary
improvements to optimise the user experience.
7.1 Automated Testing
Unit testing was used for the method of automated testing. Unit testing is a software testing
methodology in which individual components or units of a software application are tested in
isolation to ensure they function correctly. A unit is the smallest testable part of a software system
and typically comprises a single function, method, or class (Osherove, 2009).
This application primarily consists of interconnected components, with the main components being
requirements 3 and 4. Moreover, the project includes numerous individual helper functions due to
the emphasis on modularity, as specified in section 6.2.1. Unit testing was selected because it helps
ensure that each component and function operates correctly in isolation before being integrated
with other components.
To implement these unit tests, the Mocha testing framework was utilised. Mocha is designed for
testing asynchronous and synchronous code in Node.js and browser-based applications (MochaJS
Contributors, 2022). Mocha was chosen due to the team's prior experience with this technology.
All unit tests were carried out in a separate file named test.js. The initial plan was to incorporate unit
tests throughout the entire project. However, creating unit tests for larger components, such as the
schedule, proved more challenging than anticipated. Consequently, manual testing was deemed
more feasible for requirements 3 and 4. Nevertheless, unit testing was still implemented for the
helper functions.
Figure 7.2 illustrates a unit test for the helper function checkPriorityTimeSpent, which is shown in
Figure 7.1. This function analyses the time spent on each goal and returns an error message if a goal
with a lower priority has more time allocated than one with a higher priority. The code in Figure 7.2
conducts two tests: the first test examines goals with an error, while the second investigates goals
without errors. Figure 7.3 presents the results of these tests, demonstrating that the output
matched the expected outcomes.

62
7.2 Manual Testing
Manual software testing involves human testers evaluating the quality of a newly developed
application by executing test cases without the use of automated tools or scripts (Kaner, Falk &
Nguyen, 1999). Black box testing was used for manual testing. Black box testing is a method that
validates the software's functionality without delving into its internal structure or implementation.
This approach emulates the end user's perspective, ensuring that the application operates as
intended and offers a user-friendly experience (Pressman & Maxim, 2014).
Use cases in black-box testing play a vital role in ensuring that software meets its functional
requirements by providing a user-centric perspective and simulating real-world scenarios that end
users are likely to experience (Pressman & Maxim, 2014). In this project, black-box testing was
applied in functionality and integration testing to ensure all components tested by the unit tests
integrate successfully, focusing on tasks such as creating, editing, and deleting events, goals, and
subjects, as well as user account management. Test cases were defined using behaviour-driven
development user stories, describing a scenario along with the expected outcome. The actual
outcome was then compared with the expected outcome to determine if the test passed or failed, as
illustrated in Table 6.1, which presents use cases for requirement 1.

7.3 Usability Testing
Usability testing is a user-centred evaluation method involving real users interacting with a product or
system to identify issues and enhance the overall user experience (Pressman & Maxim, 2014). This
chapter presents the objectives, target audience, and methodology of the usability testing conducted on
the application.
7.3.1 Objectives
1. The primary objectives of this usability testing were to:
2. Assess the ease of use and visual clarity of the calendar.
3. Evaluate the user experience when creating, editing, and deleting events, goals, and subjects.
4. Verify the correct display and integration of events with the calendar and related subjects.
5. Assess the integration of goals with tasks and other features, such as their display on the sidebar.
6. Test the user interaction by scheduling study sessions using the calendar.
7. Evaluate the integration of study sessions with corresponding goals.
8. Assess the effectiveness of notifications in highlighting schedule optimisation opportunities.
The application is designed for a diverse range of users who need time management and scheduling
assistance. Five willing participants were selected for the usability testing, and their identities were kept
anonymous for ethical reasons
7.3.2 Methodology
The following methodology was employed to conduct the usability testing, ensuring ethical
considerations were met:
1. Participants received a Participant Information Sheet and Consent form before the usability test
meeting, which they must sign and return.
2. The usability test was conducted via Microsoft Teams, which allowed screen recording and
remote control of the researcher's screen by the participant.
3. The screen was shared, and participants were asked to request control to interact with the app.
4. Participants were provided with dummy data to work with, ensuring the protection of personal
information.
5. Participants were asked to complete prescribed tasks using the app while 'thinking aloud.' The
researcher made observation notes in addition to the participants' utterances.
6. After completing the tasks, participants were asked a series of questions to further probe their
opinions on the app's strengths and weaknesses.
7. Audio/video recordings of each session were created and stored securely on an encrypted cloud
server. These recordings were used to create anonymised content logs and transcripts. Once
completed, the recordings were securely destroyed to protect participants' confidentiality and
anonymity.
8. Quantitative measures, such as task completion time and number of taps, as well as qualitative
measures based on participants' comments and answers, were extracted from the content logs
and transcripts.
64
7.3.3 Findings
7.3.3.1 Number of clicks
The number of clicks used to complete each task was retrieved from the recorded videos to measure the
ease of navigation for each component. These results were averaged to find the average number of clicks
for each task and compared to the minimum number of clicks possible to complete this task. Figure 7.4
displays a graph comparing the minimum number of clicks to the average number of clicks.
7.3.3.2 Error rate per task
The usability test documented errors for each task by reviewing the recorded videos. Errors included
incorrect inputs, misusing features, and navigation issues. However, only navigation issues were
prevalent enough to yield significant findings. Consequently, navigation errors were the primary focus
when recording issues for each task. To calculate the error rate, the total number of navigation errors
made by all participants for a specific task was divided by the total number of attempts for that task. The
result was then multiplied by 100 to express the error rate as a percentage. Figure 7.5 displays the error
rate per task.

clicks and the average number of clicks per task
65
7.3.3.3 Interviews

7.3.4 Discussion
The following section reflects on the Findings from the usability testing and demonstrates how the
results were used to improve the requirements and the application's design.
The usability test data reveals that editing an event is a cumbersome process, as evidenced by the
fact that it requires over three times the number of clicks shown in Figure 7.4. Moreover, the edit
event functionality exhibits a substantial 60% error rate, as depicted in Figure 7.5. Furthermore,
three out of five participants suggested enhancing the clarity of the event editing process.
This feedback suggests that users may face difficulty in discerning the correct approach to editing an
event. Presently, users need to click the calendar box to edit a goal, which deviates from the editing
process for goals and subjects, where a pencil icon is provided. The event display was updated to
address this issue, as illustrated in Figure 6.4. The revised event display, shown in Figure 6.5, now
incorporates an edit pencil icon, signifying the method for editing an event. Utilising a pencil icon
ensures consistency with other editing buttons throughout the application.
Figure 7.4 illustrates that adding a goal required an average of just over seven clicks, which is unusually
high for such a straightforward task. Additionally, Figure 7.5 reveals that 80% of users encountered
navigation difficulties when attempting to edit a goal. In the post-test interviews, three out of five
participants expressed needing clearer indications for deleting tasks.
It can be suggested that the primary reason for the high error rate is the lack of clarity regarding task
deletion. To address this issue, the design of the edit goal form has been revised to enhance the visibility
and understanding of task deletion. As displayed in Figure 6.5, the updated task section of the goal form
now incorporates a trash bin icon, which more effectively conveys the method for removing tasks to the
users. This improvement aims to reduce the error rate and streamline the user experience.
Figure 6.6: Redesigned task management section
Figure 6.4: Original event display Figure 6.5: Redesigned event display
68
Task selection posed the most significant challenges, as adding a task session became the most errorprone process, requiring an average of 16 extra clicks, as illustrated in Figure 7.4. All users experienced
navigation difficulties with this component, as depicted in Figure 7.5, and 4 out of 5 users mentioned this
issue during their interviews. This problem led 3 out of 5 participants to hesitate to recommend the app,
emphasising the need for a solution. It can therefore be suggested that the application lacks details to
allow the user to understand how to create a task session.
In response to the feedback, a toolbar button was introduced, which, when clicked, displayed a 5-second
GIF demonstrating how to add a task session. Unfortunately, the screen recorders used to create the GIF
failed to capture the dropdown options accurately, leaving the issue unresolved due to time constraints.
Figure 6.7 showcases the demonstration popup.
Despite time constraints, essential design and requirement modifications were implemented based
on the findings from the usability testing. However, it was not feasible to conduct another round of
usability testing to evaluate the effectiveness of these changes.
7.4 Conclusion
In conclusion, this chapter has provided a comprehensive overview of the testing strategies
employed during the application development, including automated testing, manual testing, and
usability testing. Despite the limitations imposed by time constraints, the testing phase proved to be
a crucial step in the development process, revealing areas that required improvement. The feedback
gathered through usability testing led to design changes that enhanced the application's usability
and user experience.
One significant aspect not addressed during the testing phase was the application's long-term
usability. As noted in the literature review, students may struggle to maintain motivation for using
Figure 6.7: Popup displaying task session creation instructions
69
time management techniques, such as scheduling, over extended periods (Wajcman, 2018). To
accurately assess the true usability of this application, it would be necessary to evaluate a student's
usage over a longer duration. Unfortunately, this was not possible within the project's limited time
frame. Nonetheless, the usability testing contributed to substantial improvements in the application
and brought attention to issues not recognised during the design and development stages.

8 Evaluation
This evaluation chapter aims to assess the project's success in meeting the specified functional and
non-functional requirements, providing a comprehensive understanding of its overall effectiveness.
This chapter will evaluate each requirement in detail and discuss how well the project has achieved
its goals. Moreover, it will touch upon future development opportunities and areas for improvement
while also reflecting on the development process, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
This project aims to create an application for students to manage better and prioritise their time.
Evaluating a project against its requirements is critical in ensuring that it meets stakeholder
expectations and delivers on its objectives. Evaluating against the requirements gives a better
understanding of the project's success. The following section evaluates whether the project has
matched the functional and non-functional requirements.
8.1 Functional requirements
8.1.1 Requirements 1 & 2 – System will allow the user to login &
System will allow the user to create-an-account
All authentication processes were successfully completed in evaluating the user authentication
requirement, ensuring that only authorised users can access the system. Although usability testing
did not include user authentication due to ethical concerns surrounding the use of personal
credentials, manual testing was employed to assess the effectiveness of these requirements. As
demonstrated in Table 6.1, the manual testing results confirmed that the user authentication
requirement has been met, providing a secure environment for users and maintaining the system's
integrity.
8.1.2 Requirement 3 - The system will have a schedule for each user
Requirement 3.1 was deemed successful, as 100% of users in the usability test found event creation
easy. Furthermore, manual and usability testing confirmed that requirements 3.2-3.6 were
effectively implemented and functioning as intended. However, sections 7.3.3.1 and 7.3.3.2 highlight
user difficulties locating the edit event feature, which was subsequently addressed, as detailed in
section 7.3.4. Due to time constraints, requirement 3.7 could not be implemented. Nevertheless,
since requirement 3.7 was labelled as a "Could Have" feature, its absence is considered insignificant.
Thus, the overall requirement has been satisfactorily met despite the unimplemented feature.
8.1.3 Requirement 4 – The system will allow the user to set goals
Requirement 4 was successfully implemented, with 80% of usability test participants indicating that
goal setting was effectively incorporated into the system. Moreover, all five participants confirmed
that requirement 4.1 was successfully implemented. Although usability testing initially revealed an
issue with requirement 4.2, the section was redesigned, as demonstrated in Figure 6.6, to address
the identified concerns and ensure a seamless user experience for goal setting.
71
8.1.4 Requirement 5 – The system should allow the user to enter their
subjects
The evaluation of requirement 5, based on findings from both manual testing and usability testing,
suggests that it was successfully met. For instance, usability test results demonstrate that all users
could add and delete subjects with minimal error rates, as shown in Figure 7.3.3.2. This evidence
indicates that the system effectively supports adding and deleting subjects, meeting the specified
requirement and contributing to a positive user experience.
8.1.5 Requirement 6 – The system should give suggestions on how to
improve their time management.
Although the requirement was initially poorly defined, it has been considered met due to the
successful implementation of extensive features. These features include the language model, which
provided solutions for users' time management inputs, and the data analysis functions that
responded to specific criteria, such as identifying instances where lower priority goals had more time
allocated than higher priority goals or when time spent on each subject was unbalanced.
Requirement testing, conducted through both manual and automated methods, proved successful.
Manual testing demonstrated that the components worked cohesively and the outputs were
displayed accurately, while unit testing confirmed the proper operation of the data analysis
functions, as illustrated in Figure 7.3. Overall this requirement was a success as 5/5 participants
found the notifications useful within the usability test
8.2 Non-functional requirements
8.2.1 Usability
The usability test results indicate that the application has successfully met the requirement, with
100% of participants stating that the app is useful for time management. Additionally, 80% of the
responses expressed a willingness to use the app if available and to recommend it to a friend.
Although the usability test identified some issues related to the usability of certain components,
design changes detailed in section 7.3.4 have addressed most of these concerns, further
demonstrating the application's effectiveness in meeting the specified requirement.
8.2.2 Security
Security measures such as SQL Injection prevention and password encryption were successfully
implemented. However, aspects of this application may still be vulnerable as restricted development
time limited the protections implemented.
8.2.3 Compatibility
A web application was selected as the chosen application type to increase the compatibility across
devices, as discussed in section 5.1.1. The application was tested using manual testing by running the
application on different browsers and devices.
72
8.3 Future development
In developing this application, it was crucial to incorporate extensive features to distinguish it within
the saturated time management app market. However, the short development time impacted the
overall quality of the application, despite the successful implementation of these features. As such,
future development priorities include delivering a more polished application with enhanced security
features, such as protection against cross-site forgery and improved authentication session
management. Additionally, completing all requirements, such as requirement 3.7, would be
addressed in future development efforts. Further usability testing will be conducted to assess the
impact of the changes made in section 7.3.4. Moreover, additional background research will be
carried out to identify features that cater to specific demographics, addressing the gap in section
2.1.6.
8.4 Reflection
This chapter has been written in first person format as it accounts for my personal reflection. In this
reflection chapter, I share my thoughts on the development process of the web application I recently
completed. Although the final deliverable is a functional web application that meets all the
requirements, there were certain disappointments and challenges I faced during the project, as well
as areas where I was able to improve my professional and technical competencies.
As mentioned in section 8.3, creating a product with unique and extensive features was prioritised
over overall quality of the application as it was important to distinguish this deliverable upon a
saturated time management market. Therefore one of the most significant disappointments I
experienced was the little time for developing in a more polished product. This means that the
application's input validation is lacking, which can potentially cause errors throughout the system.
Additionally, I would have liked to research more about front-end design to create a better user
interface, but unfortunately, I lacked experience in that area. Moreover, testing frameworks could
have been implemented more successfully, and more information could have been retrieved,
especially for usability testing.
Despite these setbacks, the development process allowed me to improve certain professional and
technical competencies. The background research stage helped me enhance my critical thinking and
analysis skills when reviewing professional papers. Furthermore, changes in the design during the
development stage pushed me to improve my adaptability and organisation skills. Additionally, I
believe that my skills in web-based technologies have grown significantly, ranging from
comprehending how web servers interact with external services to gaining a deeper understanding
of front-end frameworks.
On a positive note, I am very pleased with the overall outcome of the project. The delivered web
application is fully functional and usable, and it provides features such as the language model and
data analysis that were not reviewed within the app analysis. The system still needs minor
improvements to provide a more polished app to market, but I believe it has a solid unique selling
proposition (USP) that the public would desire.

Appendix
1 Usability test transcript
1. 1 Participant 1
Did you find it easy setting up a schedule of events in the app? What did you find easy or difficult with
this task?
Setting up events were straightforward, nothing was particularly difficult however I thought the cancel
button was in the incorrect place
Were there any features or options you felt were missing or could be improved when creating a
schedule of events?
You should check the inputs to make sure they are correct as I think I submitted the wrong value and I
couldn’t check
Did you find it easy setting up goals in the app? What did you find easy or difficult with this task?
Setting up the goals was straightforward as well, I would have assumed that there was hover help
however, there was none.
Were there any features or options you felt were missing or could be improved when creating a goal?
I would have liked to have hover help so as so I would know what each input was requiring more clearly.
Also I thought the buttons to delete tasks were unclear as the just looked like ‘X’’s which made them look
like apart of the task text
How well do you think the app integrates the scheduling of events and goal-setting features?
Yes I thought this was okay if you knew what you are doing however it would be useful to have more
guidance especially the feature to add task sessions.
Do you think the notifications feature is useful?
Yes I thought this was essential
Overall, how satisfied are you with the app's features?
I am satisfied
Do you think the app would be useful in terms of helping you with time management related to your
studies? Would you use it if it was available? Please explain your answer.
Yes I think it would and I would use it because it gives me a good overall indication on how I am
progressing with my tasks.
How likely would you be to recommend this app to a friend or fellow student?
I am likely to recommend this to another student
79
1.2 Participant 2
Did you find it easy setting up a schedule of events in the app? What did you find easy or difficult with
this task?
Creating an event was easy and I liked how you could see the colour of the subject on the calendar
however I did think the crosses next to the event type were unnecessary
Were there any features or options you felt were missing or could be improved when creating a
schedule of events?
I would remove this crosses as previously mentioned.
Did you find it easy setting up goals in the app? What did you find easy or difficult with this task?
I was able to create goals easily however I found the display for the select menus confusing as they
looked like text boxes
Were there any features or options you felt were missing or could be improved when creating a goal?
I thought the task deletion buttons were confusing
How well do you think the app integrates the scheduling of events and goal-setting features?
It was all good however, I found it difficult to know what to do to add a task session
Do you think the notifications feature is useful?
Yes I could see how it would improve how I varied out my time
Overall, how satisfied are you with the app's features?
Somewhat satisfied
Do you think the app would be useful in terms of helping you with time management related to your
studies? Would you use it if it was available? Please explain your answer.
Yes I think this is a better alternative for normal schedules as it allows me to set goals, however the task
session feature must improve
How likely would you be to recommend this app to a friend or fellow student?
I would definitely recommend this to a friend as I know a lot of them have bad time management
80
1.3 Participant 3
Did you find it easy setting up a schedule of events in the app? What did you find easy or difficult with
this task?
Adding events was easy, however I could not figure out how to had a task session
Were there any features or options you felt were missing or could be improved when creating a
schedule of events?
An improvement would be to add instructions on how to add a task session as it is impossible to know
otherwise
Did you find it easy setting up goals in the app? What did you find easy or difficult with this task?
Yes goal setting was very easy, there were no difficulties
Were there any features or options you felt were missing or could be improved when creating a goal?
It would help making the new goal button a bit more clear, it is a bit small compared to the other
buttons. I also think it would be good to add an indication on when the goal is past its due date
How well do you think the app integrates the scheduling of events and goal-setting features?
Apart from adding task session I think the integration works well, I like how you can add subjects to goals
and events
Do you think the notifications feature is useful?
I think it would help initially but may get annoying after time, I also didn’t know what the search bar was
for
Overall, how satisfied are you with the app's features?
Somewhat satisfied
Do you think the app would be useful in terms of helping you with time management related to your
studies? Would you use it if it was available? Please explain your answer.
Yes I think I would use this however im not sure how long I would use it for as I have used similar apps
but have never stuck with them
How likely would you be to recommend this app to a friend or fellow student?
I probably wouldn’t recommend it at this stage due the the task session not working
81
1.4 Participant 4
Did you find it easy setting up a schedule of events in the app? What did you find easy or difficult with
this task?
The actual event was easy to add. It was impossible to know how to add task session
Were there any features or options you felt were missing or could be improved when creating a
schedule of events?
I thought it was difficult to know how to edit the task session or event. Maybe add an indication on that
pressing them would edit them, changing how the mouse interacts with the buttons will help to
determine what is clickable and what is not
Did you find it easy setting up goals in the app? What did you find easy or difficult with this task?
Yes goals were easy. However adding tasks were not that clear
Were there any features or options you felt were missing or could be improved when creating a goal?
No not really apart from adding tasks
How well do you think the app integrates the scheduling of events and goal-setting features?
I think the app integrated both features well if there was a better indication of how to add task sessions
Do you think the notifications feature is useful?
I couldn’t use the app enough to really find it useful however I think it would be useful once using it for a
longer period of time
Overall, how satisfied are you with the app's features?
Somewhat satisfied
Do you think the app would be useful in terms of helping you with time management related to your
studies? Would you use it if it was available? Please explain your answer.
Yes I think I would use this however im not sure how long I would use it for
How likely would you be to recommend this app to a friend or fellow student?
Yes I would recommend this as I haven’t seen anything similar before.

this task?
It was easy to add events but unclear how to add task sessions

schedule of events?
It would be good to Include an add task to board demonstrating how to add it
Did you find it easy setting up goals in the app? What did you find easy or difficult with this task?
Yes adding goals was easy
Were there any features or options you felt were missing or could be improved when creating a goal?
I think it would be good to view the remaining days. Also I think it would be good if there were rewards to
give me an incentive
How well do you think the app integrates the scheduling of events and goal-setting features?
Very well I thought it had a really good layout
Do you think the notifications feature is useful?
yes
Overall, how satisfied are you with the app's features?
